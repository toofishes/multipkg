# TODO list:
# * Support configuration in some fashion of cache directories
# * Support binding to only certain interfaces
# * Add a default mirror capability
# * Improve group awareness. We should look at sending out pings/pongs
#   and expiring hosts we don't hear from. A few UDP packages every minute
#   won't hurt anyone.
# * Allow for some fallback to known hosts. This would involve sending
#   a UDP packet directly to a host rather than the multicast address, and
#   then having that host act as a bridge.
#
#   [Machine A] <--- UDP unicast ---> [Machine B]     [Machine C]
#                                                \   /
#                                           <UDP multicast>
#                                                  |
#                                             [Machine D]
#
# * To do the above, we will probably have to beef up the data sent on
#   the wire. It might be smart to pickle something up where the following
#   keys are known:
#     - req: ping, pong, gone, search, found, notfound
#     - pkg: package name if it makes sense
#     - dest: dest address so we can determine multicast/unicast
#     - reqid: some unique ID so we don't propagate too many packets?
